        <img src="Ladies_of_Tang_Dynasty.jpg" alt="Ladies of Tang Dynasty" style="width: 200px;height: 300px;">
        <p>This watercolor painting is my artistic interpretation of a Tang Dynasty lady, inspired by the elegance and
            opulence of that era. I aimed to capture her poised demeanor and timeless grace through soft brushstrokes
            and a harmonious blend of colors. The flowing green and red robe, along with her iconic high bun, reflects
            the richness of Tang Dynasty fashion. I used a muted purple background to create depth and atmosphere,
            allowing the figure to stand out. The calligraphy inscription adds a historical touch, reinforcing the
            cultural essence of this piece. Through this work, I express my deep admiration for traditional Chinese art.

        <img src="Puerto_Street.jpg" alt="Puerto Street" style="width: 220px;height: 300px;">
        <p>This sketch captures the essence of a lively, historic street in a Puerto Rico.
            Using fine ink lines, I depicted the charming architecture with intricate balconies, detailed facades, and
            bustling urban life. The sloping street, filled with cars and pedestrians, adds depth and perspective,
            guiding the viewer's eye into the distance. Overhead wires crisscross, enhancing the dynamic atmosphere. A
            small ink blot unintentionally adds character to the scene. The interplay of light shading and precise lines
            creates a sense of vibrancy, making this drawing a tribute to the timeless beauty of city streets.
