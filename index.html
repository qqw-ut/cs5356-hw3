        <img src="Ladies_of_Tang_Dynasty.jpg" alt="Ladies of Tang Dynasty" style="width: 200px;height: 300px;">
        <p>This watercolor painting is my artistic interpretation of a Tang Dynasty lady, inspired by the elegance and
            opulence of that era. I aimed to capture her poised demeanor and timeless grace through soft brushstrokes
            and a harmonious blend of colors. The flowing green and red robe, along with her iconic high bun, reflects
            the richness of Tang Dynasty fashion. I used a muted purple background to create depth and atmosphere,
            allowing the figure to stand out. The calligraphy inscription adds a historical touch, reinforcing the
            cultural essence of this piece. Through this work, I express my deep admiration for traditional Chinese art.
